Bunch of my work that I think are worth sharing on the internet. Though I had
to lower my standards upon realizing how little material of such quality I've
created.

1. [Lambda Calculus Notes](lambda-notes.pdf). My notes from the UofT
mentorship program about the lambda-calculus. Still needs some polishing and I
also intend to make a lambda-calculus interpreter for this by using the 
definitions.

2. [Lambda Calculus Presentation](lambda-pres.pdf). The presentation I
gave at for the UofT mentorship program.

3. [Fibonacci Triangle Problem](fib-triangle.pdf). My solution to an 
interesting number theory (?) problem involving a triangle of fibonacci 
numbers.

4. [A proof of the additivity of the Riemann integral](integral_property.pdf).
Most textbooks which prove the property
$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \int_a^c f(x)\,dx + \int_c^b f(x)\,dx
$$
do it via upper and lower sums and the Darboux definition of the Riemann 
integral. Textbooks which don't cover the Darboux definition usually skip
the proof of this fact. This is because a satisfying proof directly from
Riemann sums has to deal with the subtle special case that $b - c$ and
$c - a$ are incommensurable and so no two Riemann partitions on the intervals
$[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$ will have equal equal subintervals. This file contains
a short proof of this fact using Riemann partitions alone.

5. [The Curse of Monte Carlo](The_Curse_of_Monte_Carlo.pdf). A worksheet
exploring the curse of dimensionality, numerical integration, and the
Monte Carlo method. Meant to introduce these ideas to intro probability students
at the University of Toronto.
