<!-- A novice blogger once asked two masters for advice. The first said "only quote
others in order to better express yourself." The second said "to make light of
blogging is to be a true blogger."-->

*"I am myself the subject of my blog."* Falsely attributed to Michel de Montaigne.

<!--
Some say that being self-deprecating in writing isn't good, but they also say
that "to make light of blogging is to be a true blogger." So what do? Well
I'll advise the reader to take a second look at everything here as they may or
may not be poorly written and poorly researched.
